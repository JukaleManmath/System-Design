"""
ðŸ”’ DOUBLE-CHECKED LOCKING SINGLETON (Thread-Safe, Lazy)

WHAT:
- A lazy-loaded Singleton that checks twice before creating an instance.
- Uses a lock only during the first initialization for thread safety.

WHY:
- Prevents multiple threads from creating separate instances.
- Avoids performance overhead by locking only once when needed.

WHEN TO USE:
- In multi-threaded systems where object creation is expensive
  (e.g., database connections, logging systems, API clients).

KEY IDEA:
- First check (_instance is None) â†’ avoids locking once initialized.
- Second check inside lock â†’ ensures only one thread creates the object.
